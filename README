=============
Kay Framework
=============

What's this
-----------

Kay is a web framework completely specialising on Google App
Engine. But basic design is based on the Django framework, like
middleware, settings and pluggable application, etc. Kay uses Werkzeug
as lower level framework, uses Jinja2 as template engine, uses babel
for handling language translations. This software is distributed under
BSD license. See LICENSE for the details.


The software that Kay bundles
-----------------------------
* babel
* jinja2
* simplejson
* werkzeug
* pytz

Dependencies
------------
* Google App Engine SDK

  If you installed zip version of the SDK(most unix style operation
  system users are so), don't forget to create a symlink pointed to
  the real SDK at /usr/local/google_appengine.
  
.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo ln -s /some/whare/google_appengine /usr/local/google_appengine    


Quick Start
-----------

* First, make symlynk of kay directory inside your project directry,
  copy settings files by invoking management script.

.. code-block:: console

   $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/tmatsuo/kay/
   $ python kay/manage.py startproject myproject
   $ cd myproject

* Second, you can create your first application with following command.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python manage.py startapp hello
   $ vi settings.py

You have to add 'hello' to the INSTALLED_APPS tupple in the
settings.py. For the details of how to define urls and views for your
application, please refer to docs/urlmapping.rst.

 * settings.py

.. code-block:: python

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'kay.sessions',
    'hello'
  )

* Run your application

.. code-block:: console

  $ python manage.py runserver


You can access your first application on the url:
  http://localhost:8080/hello/

* Upload your application

.. code-block:: console

  $ python manage.py appcfg update


* You can handle i18n like following. For the details of i18n, please
  refer to docs/i18n.rst.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python manage.py extract_messages hello
   $ python manage.py add_translations hello -l ja
   $ vi hello/i18n/ja/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
   $ python manage.py compile_translations hello

You can also merge newly added catalogue into your translations as
follows.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python manage.py extract_messages hello
   $ python manage.py update_translations hello -l ja
   $ vi hello/i18n/ja/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
   $ python manage.py compile_translations hello


Shell tools
-----------

* Invoking `python manage.py shell` gives you python (or ipython if
  available) console session with the same DatastoreFileStub settings
  of local dev server. For the details of manage.py commands, please
  refer to docs/manage_py.rst.

**Note:**

  The local dev server reads datastore data file only on startup. So,
  the dev server will never notice about the datastore operation on
  your console session. You must restart your dev server for
  reflecting the result of the console sessions.

* Invoking `python manage.py rshell` is the same as above except for
  using RemoteDatastore stub. You can access the data on the
  production server.

**Note:**
  
  Please be careful when you use this feature.


Datastore
---------

* You must use GAE models directly. You can use kay.utils.forms for
  form handling. You can construct a form automatically from the model
  definition with kay.utils.forms.modelform.ModelForm. For the details
  of how to use forms, please refer to docs/forms-usage.rst.

* By default, db.Model.kind() returns ('model's app name' + _ + 'model
  name').lower(). So when you see the management console, there will
  be 'appname_modelname' style kind names . Please don't be surprised
  with those names.

  You can change this behaviour by settings ADD_APP_PREFIX_TO_KIND to
  False in your settings.py.

* Experimental db_hook feature is now available on tmatsuo branch. To
  use this feature, you have to set USE_DB_HOOK to True in your top
  level settings.py file. Also you have to register your hooks
  beforehands somewhere in your code. I recommend you to do this in
  appname/__init__.py because Kay always load this file on startup as
  long as appname is on your INSTALLED_APPS. Here is an example for
  registering a hook that logs dumpped represantation of the saved
  entry and whether this operation is creating a new entity or
  updating an existing entity.

.. code-block:: python

  import logging

  from kay.utils import db_hook
  from kay.utils.db_hook import put_type

  from hoge.models import Entry

  def log_instance(entity, put_type_id):
    from kay.utils.repr import dump
    logging.info(dump(entity))
    logging.info("put_type: %s" % put_type.get_name(put_type_id))

  register_post_save_hook(log_instance, Entry)


Forms
-----

* To define form class, you can define a class that extends
  kay.utils.forms.Form. For example the code bellow will give you the
  form contains two text fields with different validators.

.. code-block:: python

    from kay.utils.forms import Form
    class PersonForm(Form):
      name = TextField(required=True)
      age = IntegerField()


You can use this form in your view like following.
 
.. code-block:: python

    from forms import PersonForm
    form = PersonForm()
    if request.method == 'POST'
      if form.validate(request.form, request.files):
        name = form['name']
	age = form['age']
        do something with valid form ...
      else:
        do something with invalid form ...


* You can also use ModelForm to create a form automatically from Model
  class.

.. code-block:: python

    from google.appengine.ext import db

    class MyModel(db.Model):
      name = db.StringProperty(required=True)
      age = db.IntegerProperty()

    from kay.utils.forms.modelform import ModelForm

    class MyForm(ModelForm):
      class Meta:
        model = MyModel
