kay
----

* Implementation for handling process_view of middleware classes.

* Write documentations about middlewares, jinja2 howtos, etc..

* Change the url of paste capability in the werkzeug debugger.

kay.utils.forms
----------------

* Make widgets can have media(javascript, css)

 * AjaxModelField


kay.sessions
------------

* Retry when GAESessionStore.save fails cos' its important to keep
  users' session data.


kay.auth
--------

* An authentication backend other than Google's auth.

 * When using apps domain, we cannot use https on our domain. We have
   to use appspot.com domain for SSL. So there will be the problem
   that Kay can not handle the cookies from our own domain.
   
   To handle this situation, parhaps we can generate random string
   internally for carrying the session values from the domain to the
   other domain.
